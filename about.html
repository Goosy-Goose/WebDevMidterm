                <h1>Mango Valley Games</h1>
                <p>Mango Valley Games is an independent game company based in Irvine, California (right next to Blizzard lol i'm not even joking) 
                    with a second location in New York City. 
                    <br><br> With an affinity for horror, we aim to put out games that leave you
                    with a story to remember. 
                    <br><br> We specialize in RPGs, but we have been known to dabble a bit into shooters. In other words, 
                    there's nothing we won't attempt.

                </p>

                <br>
                <h1>Our Story</h1>
                <p>
                    MVG was founded by a student who wanted to tell a story. Since then, we've honed our abilities and continue to 
                    improve our games. We are firm believers that games give audiences immersive storytelling experiences that have  
                    the power to change lives. 
                    <br><br> We want to create works of art that resonate with people around the world. Each game we make is 
                    lovingly crafted from the tiniest detail to the biggest picture in order to give players unique experiences 
                    with every game they play.
